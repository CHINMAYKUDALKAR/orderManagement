* **Tamper-proof activity logs:** Every access attempt and action is recorded on blockchain for transparency.
* **Privacy-focused alternative to Google Drive/Dropbox:** Zero trust architecture with no vendor access to user data.
* **Fast, simple, and secure file sharing:** Secure links, expiring access, and metadata stored on blockchain.

BlockVault combines usability with unmatched security—making it ideal for sensitive data environments.
